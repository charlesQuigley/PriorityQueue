1. Intellij IDEA 2020.2.3 Community Edition. (IDE)
2. A computer running Windows OS.


This program is coded in Java.

I believe this program will run on any computer that has Intellij IDEA 2020.2.3,
but I have not tested it on Mac. So to be safe, please run this program on a Windows computer.

Intellij IDEA 2020.2.3 Community Edition is the latest free IDE by JetBrains.
I believe this program will run on older versions of Intellij IDEA, but I have only
tested it on the 2020.2.3 version. As such, if the program does not run on an older version,
please download the newest version of Intellij IDEA.
